# Stocks Price Predictions using Streamlit, Container Registry and App Service in Azure.

This project has been highly technical, trying to build a functional web app, that predicts the prices of stocks over time
using the Prophet model. In the stocks app, I have loaded the data and built the model. Every other action such as visualizations, predictions, are happening in the main file
so app.py .I have used the streamlit library to create a satisfiable UI and then I have containerized the app, creating an image at Azure Cloud and in the end deploying it from
local to cloud availability. 

If you are interested to have a look how the app looks like, please feel free:
